 title: Global vegetation dynamics
 dataset_id: AVHRR
 short_description: |
  Annual bias and trend-corrected metrics on intra-annual 
  vegetation dynamics expressed through the NDVI
 long_description: |
  This dataset  provides intra-annual metrics based on a daily time-series 
  of Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI). This time-series was 
  corrected to account for the continued deterioration of the AVHRR sensors 
  following the methodology proposed by Hansen et al. (2016).
