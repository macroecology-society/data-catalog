 title: Bias-corrected CCI land cover
 dataset_id: CCI_ilc
 short_description: |
  Trend-corrected CCI land cover dataset with annual and global 
  data on per-pixel percentages of 27 classes.
 long_description: |
  This dataset corrects issues observed in land cover dataset of ESA's Climate 
  Change Initiative (CCI). The original data maps implausible changes caused by 
  methodological artificats, which often manifest as false, country-wide land 
  cover transitions. We corrected for these anomalies with the support ofannual 
  Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) data mapped at a 300-m resolution, which 
  we used to identify and correct erroneous pixels. The output is a 
  bias-corrected land cover dataset with novel class combinations and 
  per-pixel percentages for dominant vegetated classes.
