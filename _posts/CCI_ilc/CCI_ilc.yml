 short_description: |
  Annual and improved CCI land cover with associated 
  data on Vegetation continuous Fields (VCF).
 long_description: |
  This dataset corrects issues observed in land cover dataset of 
  ESA's Climate Change Initiative (CCI). The original data depicts 
  implausible changes caused by methodological artificats, which often 
  manifest as extensive, country-wide land cover transitions. We corrected 
  for these issues by modelling annual Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) at 
  a 300-m, which we then used to identify and correct misclassified pixels. 
  The output is a bias-corrected CCI land cover dataset, with novel class 
  combinations and per-pixel percentages for dominant vegetated classes, which 
  can be used to
