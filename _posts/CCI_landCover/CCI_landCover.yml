 title: CCI land cover
 dataset_id: CCI_landCover
 short_description: |
  Global, yearly land cover derived in the context of the 
  Climate Change Initiative (CCI), from 1992 to the present
 long_description: |
  This data provides information on the spatial and temporal 
  evolution of 22 land cover classes, which have been defined 
  using the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's 
  (UN FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). To produce 
  this dataset, the entire Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer 
  (MERIS) Full and Reduced Resolution archive from 2003 to 2012 was 
  first classified into a unique 10-year baseline LC map. This is then
  back- and up-dated using change detected from (i) Advanced 
  Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) time series from 1992 to 1999, 
  (ii) SPOT-Vegetation (SPOT-VGT) time series from 1998 to 2012 and (iii) 
  PROBA-Vegetation (PROBA-V) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (S3 OLCI) time series from 2013.
