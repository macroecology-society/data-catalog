 title: Annual permafrost extents 
 dataset_id: CCI_permafrost
 short_description: |
  Time-series of the extent of permafrost in the northern hemisphere
 long_description: |
  Permafrost underlies approximately one quarter of the terrestrial 
  Northern Hemisphere. Under the threat of climate change, the warming 
  soils lead permafrost to decrease in extent, affecting the microbial 
  breakdown of organic carbon and the consequent release of greenhouse 
  gases. This dataset allows us to observed the long-term variability of 
  permafrost. Developed in the context of the Climate Change Initiative 
  (CCI), this dataset covers the period of 1997 to 2018 at a 1-km resolution. 
  We resampled this dataset to a 300-m resolution. When the permafrost cover 
  was below 100%, the respective percent cover was divided equaly among the 
  300-m pixels underlying a 1-km pixel. Additionally, the period of 1992 to 
  1996 was covered by replicating the 1997 state.
