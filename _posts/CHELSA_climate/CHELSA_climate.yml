 short_description: Global time-series of climate variables
 long_description: |
  CHELSA provides monthly data on precipitation and temperature, derived 
  by downscaling global atmospheric models. The temperature data is based 
  on statistical  downscaling  of  atmospheric  temperatures, while the 
  precipitation data incorporates orographic predictors such as wind fields, 
  valley exposition,  and  boundary  layer  height,  with  a  subsequent  
  bias  correction. This dataset provides annual aggregates of CHELSA 
  based on monthly precipitation, Potential Evapotranspiration (PET), 
  and minimum, maxmimum and  mean temperatures.
