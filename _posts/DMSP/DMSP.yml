 short_description: data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Nighttime light (NTL)
 long_description: This dataset provides yearly, global maps on the spatial and temporal variability of night lights. This dataset derives a temporally consistent NTL dataset by harmonizing DMSP data with simulated DMSP-like NTL observations from the VIIRS data.
