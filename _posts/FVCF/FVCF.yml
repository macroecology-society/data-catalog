  Fused MODIS-AVHRR Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF)
 long_description: |
  This dataset extends on the AVHRR-based VCF dataset 
  developed by Hansen et al. (2016) by integrating MODIS 
  and Copernicus data. We used a Random Forest model to 
  translate these data into AVHRR-like layers, assuring 
  their continuity past 2016 in support of multi-decadal 
  monitoring applications.
