 short_description: |
  Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, reflecting the most recently 
  compiled and harmonized subnational livestock distribution data for 2010. 
 long_description: |
  This dataset downscales national and subnational statistics based on the 
  spatial variability of gridded data on environmental and socio-economic 
  drivers. This is achieved through a Random Forest modeling framework, 
  and results on several layers with per-pixel densities of individual 
  types of livestock, such as cattle, horses, and chickens. The dataset 
  also provides the original statitical data in gridded form.
