  This dataset offers different classifications of mountains following 
  different definitions. The K1 resource used a 1 km DEM which was processed 
  using a combination of elevation, slope and relative relief. Relative relief, 
  or ruggedness, is the difference between maximum and minimum elevation in a 
  moving neighborhood analysis window (NAW) and is computed for every raster 
  cell. The K1 layer defined six classes of mountains, where the upper three 
  classes were defined by elevation ranges. The lower three classes were 
  defined either by a combination of elevation and slope, or elevation 
  and relative relief. The circular NAW for computing the relative relief 
  used a 5 pixel (~7 km) radius for an approximate NAW size of 150 km2. 
  The K2 resource was developed using ruggedness as the determining factor, 
  where any relative relief greater than 200m in the NAW was considered 
  mountainous. The original K2 resource used a 1 km DEM and an approximately 
  9km2 NAW to determine relative relief and then generalized the relative 
  relief surface to an approximately 4.5 km grid (at the equator). The K3 
  resource was developed using a finer spatial resolution (250 m) DEM and 
  feature-based extraction algorithms with variable NAW sizes used to extract 
  a set of global Hammond landforms with 16 landform types, of which four were 
  mountain classes. E. H. Hammond was a pioneer of landform mapping and 
  described three parameters for distinguishing different types of plains, 
  hills, mountains, and tablelands. The three classification parameters 
  are slope, relative relief, and profile, where the profile parameter 
  assesses the amount of relatively flat terrain in upland locations to 
  delineate tablelands. The 250 m global Hammond landforms product was 
  based on an automated extraction of classes in a GIS environment, and 
  the K3 mountains product was an export of the four mountain classes 
  into a global mountains datalayer.
