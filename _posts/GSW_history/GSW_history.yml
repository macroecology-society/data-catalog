  Historical metrics on Global Surface Water (GSW)
 long_description: |
  This dataset provides historical metrics on the 
  global behavior of surface water measured over 
  the full extent of the GSW dataset. The original 
  data, provided at a 30-m resolution, was aggregagted 
  to 300-m and depicts per-pixel percentages.
