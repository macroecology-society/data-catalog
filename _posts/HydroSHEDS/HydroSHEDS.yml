    Deliniated of watershed at different hierarchical levels
  long_description: |
    These data were obtaiend from the HydroBASINS dataset, which offers 
    spatial data on watershed boundaries at multiple hierarchical levels. 
    The watershed deliniation follows the topological concept of the 
    Pfafstetter coding system (levels 1-12). Here, we use only a subset 
    of the afformentioned dataset, comprising Pfafstetter levels 2, 3, and 12.
