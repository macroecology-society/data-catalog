 title: LAI_phenology
 short_description: |
  Typical phenology of deciduous forests derived with PROBA-V data time-series
 long_description: |
  This dataset provides information on the average per-pixel 
  phenology of deciduous forests. It maps the Start of Season 
  (SoS), Mid of Season (MoS) and End of Season (EoS), which is 
  through a threshold method applied over a time-series of intra 
  and inter-annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). 
  The NDVI time-series was measured with the PROBA-V between 1999 and 2017.
