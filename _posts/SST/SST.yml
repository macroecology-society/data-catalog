 short_description: |
  Yearly maximum Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
 long_description: |
  This dataset maps the global, yearly maximum SST from 
  daily, mean estimates. The daily estimates are the result 
  of the fusion of data from multiple satellite sensors. It 
  combines data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers 
  (AVHRRs), the series of Along Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSRs), 
  and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR).
