 title: Annual water balance 
 dataset_id: TerraClimate
 short_description: |
  Global climate and water balance time series.
 long_description: |
  This dataset provides monthly climate and climatic water 
  balance variables. TerraClimate uses climatically aided 
  interpolation, combining high-spatial resolution climatological 
  normals from the WorldClim dataset, with coarser resolution time 
  varying (i.e., monthly) data from other sources to produce a monthly 
  dataset of precipitation, temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure, 
  and solar radiation. TerraClimate additionally produces monthly 
  surface water balance datasets using a water balance model that 
  incorporates reference evapotranspiration, precipitation, 
  temperature, and interpolated plant extractable 
  soil water capacity.
