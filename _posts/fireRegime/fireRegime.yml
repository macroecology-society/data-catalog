 title: Global fire regime
 dataset_id: fireRegime
 short_description: |
  Characterization of the frequency and recurrence of fires
 long_description: |
  This dataset offers multi-temporal metrics that describe the frequency and 
  recurrency of fires on a per-pixel basis. These metrics are derived from 
  annual maximum fire extents as mapped by the MODIS MCD64A1 product.
