 title: FLO1K
 short_description: |
  Global time-series of land surface streamflow
 long_description: |
  This dataset provides yearly statistical metrics 
  on streamflow dynamics. They were derived with 
  artificial neural networks (ANNs) regression, 
  trained with 6600 monitoring and a variety of 
  environmental predictors, such as topography and climate.
