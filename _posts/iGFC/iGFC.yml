 short_description: |
  Forest cover density time-series from 1992 to 2018
 long_description: |
  This dataset fuses multiple remote sensing datasets 
  with different spatial and temporal resolutions to 
  construct a consistent, annual, and gap-free time-series 
  on tree cover starting in 1992 as informed by 
  state-of-the-art data on canopy densities obtained through 
  the Global Forest Change dataset.
