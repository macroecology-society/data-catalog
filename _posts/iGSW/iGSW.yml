 title: Bias-corrected global surface water
 dataset_id: iGSW
 short_description: |
  Annual, gap-filled, and trend-adjusted Global Surface Water
 long_description: |
  This dataset fills data gaps in the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset 
  by Pekel et al (2016) and correct for prediction biases in the original 
  data using machine learning. It maps annual per-pixel percentages of 
  surface water, both permanent and seasonal.
