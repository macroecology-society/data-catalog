 dataset_id: luckiProb
 short_description: |
  Annual probability layers for different agriculture commodities
 long_description: |
  We mapped probabilities for the spatial distribution 
  of hundreds of crop types and other land management 
  practices (e.g. logging, pasturelands), returing 
  per-pixel probabilities for each category.
