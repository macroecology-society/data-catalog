 short_description: |
  Per-pixel areas for global applications
 long_description: |
  This dataset provides per-pixel estimtes of areas 
  within a WGS84, lat/lon grid. This layer was derived 
  with the Harvesine method, which estimates the distance 
  in meters of a distance between two geographical points. 
  This method was used to estimate the distance between the 
  edges of a pixel, across both latitude and longitude. These 
  distances were then used to estimate the are of the pixel.
