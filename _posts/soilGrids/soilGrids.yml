 title: soilGrids
 short_description: Gridded soil database (soilGrids) 
 long_description: This dataset provides global maps of soil properties derived with state-of-the-art machine learning methods. SoilGrids prediction models are fitted using over 230,000 soil profile observations from the WoSIS database and a series of environmental covariates. Covariates were selected from a pool of over 400 environmental layers (e.g. climate, land cover), and originated from different data products derived with Earth observation data. The outputs of SoilGrids are global soil property maps at six standard depth intervals (according to the GlobalSoilMap IUSS working group and its specifications). Prediction uncertainty is quantified by the lower and upper limits of a 90% prediction interval.
