 title: BECK_climateMap
 short_description: Global Koppen-Geiger climate classification at a 1-km resolution for the present-day (1980 to 2016) and for projected future conditions (2071 to 2100) under climate change
 long_description: The present-day map is derived from an ensemble of four high-resolution, topographically-corrected climatic maps. The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications. The new maps exhibit a higher classification accuracy and substantially more detail than previous maps, particularly in regions with sharp spatial or elevation gradients.
