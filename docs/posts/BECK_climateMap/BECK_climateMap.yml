 short_description: |
  Global Koppen-Geiger climate classification at a 1-km resolution for the 
  present-day (1980 to 2016) and for projected future conditions (2071 to 2100) 
  under climate change
 long_description: |
  The present-day map is derived from an ensemble of four high-resolution, 
  topographically-corrected climatic maps. The future map is derived from an 
  ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing 
  the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic 
  maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble 
  spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications. 
  The new maps exhibit a higher classification accuracy and substantially more detail 
  than previous maps, particularly in regions with sharp spatial or elevation gradients.
