 title: Cumulative Basin Metrics (CBM)
 dataset_id: CBM
 short_description: Mean values of selected metrics aggregated dow-/upstream
 long_description: |
  The CBM dataset uses higher-level basin delineations of the HydroSHEDS dataset. 
  For each pixel, the corresponding value is an average estimated along the downstream 
  (or upstream) path of water based on the connectivity of each basin.
