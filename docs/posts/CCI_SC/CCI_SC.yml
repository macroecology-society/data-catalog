  Global time-series of annual snow cover
 long_description: |
  This dataset extends on the AVHRR-based, daily, per-pixel proportions 
  of snow cover estimated in the scope of Climate Change Initiative (CCI). 
  Here, we aggregated the daily layers on a monthly basis, reporting on 
  maximum,  annual, per-pixel percentages, and on the frequency of months 
  with observed snow cover.
