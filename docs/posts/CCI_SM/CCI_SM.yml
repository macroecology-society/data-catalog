  Global time-series of soil moisture, from 1978 to the present
 long_description: |
  This dataset was developed in the context of the Climate Change 
  Initiative (CCI), and maps soil moisture on monthly basis from 
  1978 to the present. The ESA CCI Soil moisture is a data fusion 
  product, combining inputs from both passive and active satellite 
  sensors. The original data is daily, but we aggregated it on a 
  monthly basis. Here, we derived a monthly weighted average, 
  weighting the time series of soil moisture at each pixel 
  coordinate by the corresponding data quality.
