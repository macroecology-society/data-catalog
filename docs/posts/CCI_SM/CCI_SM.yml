 short_description: |
  Global time-series of soil moisture, from 1978 to the present
 long_description: |
  This product is based on daily soil moisture estimates, developed 
  in the context of the Climate Change Initiative (CCI). Here, we 
  aggregated those monthly estimates into monthly averages weighted 
  based on prediction uncertainties, and then used those monthly 
  estimates to derive annual climatologies.
