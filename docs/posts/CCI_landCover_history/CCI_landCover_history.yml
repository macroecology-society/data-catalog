 title: CCI_landCover_history
 short_description: |
  Historical maximum extent of generic land cover types derived from the 
  CCI land cover dataset
 long_description: |
  This dataset provides historical representations of the spatial distribution 
  of generic land cover classes. To derive these data, we thematicaly aggregated 
  the CCI land cover into generic class groups (e.g. `agriculture`, `desertic`) 
  on a yearly basis. Then, for each derived layer, we derived a mask with its 
  maximum historical extent. Finally, we resampled the output to a 1-km 
  resolution, depicting per-pixel percentages of the given class group.
