 title: Global high-resolution climate
 dataset_id: CHELSA
 short_description: Global monthly time-series of precipitation and temperature.
 long_description: |
  CHELSA provides monthly data on precipitation and temperature, derived by 
  downscaling global atmospheric models. The temperature data is based  on  
  statistical  downscaling  of  atmospheric  temperatures, while the 
  precipitation data incorporates orographic predictors such as wind fields, 
  valley exposition,  and  boundary  layer  height,  with  a  subsequent  
  bias  correction.
