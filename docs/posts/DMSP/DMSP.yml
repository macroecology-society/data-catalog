 title: Annual nighttime lights
 dataset_id: DMSP
 short_description: |
  Global time-series of Nighttime light intensities mapped by 
  the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)
 long_description: |
  This dataset provides yearly, global maps on the spatial and temporal 
  variability of night lights (NTL). This dataset derives a temporally 
  consistent NTL dataset by harmonizing DMSP data, availble up to 2013, 
  with simulated DMSP-like NTL observations from the VIIRS data. With 
  this method, we obtain a longer DMSP time-series, up to 2018.
