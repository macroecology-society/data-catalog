  Fused MODIS-AVHRR Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF)
 long_description: |
  This dataset extends on the AVHRR-based VCF dataset developed 
  by Hansen et al. (2016), complementing the last years of the 
  time-series (2017-2019) by integrating MODIS VCF data. Here, 
  we used a Random Forest (RF) model to translate the MODIS VCF 
  data into a AVHRR-like values, and derive a contiguous time-series.
