 title: Global administrative boundaries
 dataset_id: GADM
 short_description: |
  Global database with an up-to-date delineation of administrative areas
 long_description: |
  The GADM dataset provides up-to-date administrative boundaries, 
  vectorized on a country-by-country basis and up to five management 
  levels. In addition, we aggregated the GADM dataset into continents 
  and regions. The regional aggregation dissolves countries following 
  the global geoscheme of the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD).
