 title: Global impervious surfaces
 dataset_id: GAIA
 short_description: |
  Annual time-series of impervious surfaces
 long_description: |
  This dataset was derived thorugh the classification of dense 
  satellite time series obtained with multiple Landsat sensors. 
  It provides data on  the first year an impervious pixel was 
  observed starting from 1985. The original dataset, with a 
  spatial resolution of 30-m, was then split into yearly layers 
  and aggreated into 300-m layers with yearly per-pixel percentages.
