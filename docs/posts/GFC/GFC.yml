  Yearly global forest cover percentages
 long_description: |
  This dataset extends on Hansen's Global Forest Change 
  (GFC) data product. The original dataset depicts yearly 
  forest cover changes and overall gains within a given 
  observation period. Here, we combine both data components 
  to derive yearly forest cover data. To the baseline of the 
  GFC, mapped for 2000, we removed percent changes on a yearly 
  basis using the reference year of change. From 2012 to 2019, 
  we additionally added information on gains. The year of 2012 
  is the first where gains are quantified. For that reason, tree 
  cover percentages from 2001 to 2011 should be handled with care.
