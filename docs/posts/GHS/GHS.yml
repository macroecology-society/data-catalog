 title: Global human settlements
 dataset_id: GHS
 short_description: |
  Multi-temporal characterization of human settlements 
  distinguishing types of land use (e.g. urban, rural), 
  counting population, and identifying built-up structures.
 long_description: |
  Produced by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), this dataset 
  offers a global, multi-temporal perspetice on the spatial 
  distribution of human populations and on urbanization patterns 
  linked to population growth. It integrates gridded data on urban 
  settlements with census data on human populations to generate a 
  combine product, downscaling census data to the pixel level.
