  Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL) Database
 long_description: |
  This dataset distinguishes water bodies connected to river networks. 
  The GRWL Database is the first global compilation of river planform 
  geometry at a constant-frequency discharge, derived with discharge 
  data from 3693 gauge stations, and 7376 Landsat TM, ETM+ scenes.
