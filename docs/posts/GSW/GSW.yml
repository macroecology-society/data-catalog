 title: GSW
 short_description: Global Surface Water (GSW)
 long_description: This dataset offers yearly data on the spatial extent of permanent and seasonal water. The original dataset, a classification of water seasonality with a  30 m resolution, was aggregated to 300 m. The output depict per-pixel percentages of permanent and seasonal water, as well as the percentage of missing data. This data was collected through Google Earth Engine (GEE).
