 short_description: |
  Annual time-series on permanent and seasonal surface water
 long_description: |
  This dataset offers yearly data on the spatial extent of 
  permanent and seasonal water. The original dataset classifies 
  water seasonality with a  30 m resolution, distinguishing 
  permanent and seasonal water. We aggregated these data to 
  300 m, reporting on per-pixel percentages of each class.
