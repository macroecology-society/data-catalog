  Yearly time-series of Global Surface Water (GSW)
 long_description: |
  This dataset offers yearly data on the spatial extent of permanent 
  and seasonal water. The original dataset, a classification of water 
  seasonality with a  30 m resolution, was aggregated to 300 m. The 
  output depict per-pixel percentages of permanent and seasonal water, 
  as well as the percentage of missing data.
