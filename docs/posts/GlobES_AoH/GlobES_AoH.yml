 title: Annual Area of Habitat (AoH)
 dataset_id: GlobES_AoH
 short_description: |
  Global and species-specific layers on the area 
  of habitat mapped on a species-by-species basis.
 long_description: |
  This dataset maps the AoH for over 34,000 species, based 
  on the habitat dependencies of each species as reported 
  by the IUCN Red List. It is derived by intersecting the 
  GlobES dataset with the species-specific range maps and 
  accounts for the accessibilty to habitat patches outside 
  the expert-drawn ranges motivated by knowledge of the 
  dispersal ability of each species.
