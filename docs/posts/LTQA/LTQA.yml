 title: Annual Landsat data quality
 dataset_id: LTQA
 short_description: |
  Landsat acquisition quality mapped on a yearly basis
 long_description: |
  This dataset provides per-pixel information on the frequency and 
  quality of Landsat acquisitions between 1982 and 2020. For each 
  year, we counted the number of acquisitions and evaluated the 
  intra-annual acqusition quality. The closer the quality metric 
  is in value to the acquisition frequency, the better the quality 
  of the satellite images. In addition, this dataset provides a 
  quality index, which is the quotient between the image quality 
  metric and the acquisition frequency. The closest the output is 
  to 1, the highest the quality of the imagery in the given year.
