  Annual tropical moist forest cover densities
 long_description: |
  The European Commissionâ€™s Joint Research Centre developed a dataset 
  on forest cover change in tropical moist forests (TMF) using 39 years 
  of Landsat time series (30 m). We aggregated these data to a 300 m 
  resolution, deriving yearly layers on sub-pixel proportions of forests. 
  Futhermore, using the long-term change information of the original dataset, 
  we reconstructed yearly extents of mangrove forest. Note that mangroves are 
  a subset of the forest cover density layers, and therefore should not be used 
  complementary.
