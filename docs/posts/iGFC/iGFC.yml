  Forest cover density time-series from 1992 to 2018
 long_description: |
  This dataset fuses multiple remote sensing products 
  derived from satellite with different spatial resolutions, 
  such as Landsat, AVHRR, and Spot. This dataset extends on 
  the time-series data from the Global Forest Change (GFC) 
  dataset, which covers the period from 2000 to the present, 
  using a spatially and temporally explicit machine learning 
  algorithm. This method integrates coarse resolution data on 
  vegetation dynamics, data on high and low-resoluton data on 
  change dynamics, and high and mid-resolution data on land 
  cover, to construct a consistent yearly forest density data 
  product from 1992 to 2018 mapped with a 300-m resolution.
