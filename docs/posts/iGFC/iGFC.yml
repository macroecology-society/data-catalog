 title: Global forest cover dynamics
 dataset_id: iGFC
 short_description: |
  Annual time-series on forest canopy densities over nearly three decades
 long_description: |
  We fused multiple remote sensing datasets mapped at 
  different spatial and temporal resolutions to construct 
  a consistent, annual, and gap-free time-series on tree 
  canpy densities starting in 1992. These data are modelled 
  with samples completed from Global Forest Change dataset.
