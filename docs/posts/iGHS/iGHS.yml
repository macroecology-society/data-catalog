  Global per-pixel counts of human populations
 long_description: |
  This dataset extends on the Global Human Settlement (GHS) dataset which 
  maps tthe number of inhabitats per pixel in 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2015. 
  Here, we linearly interpolated this data on a yearly basis, deriving 
  global population counts between 1992 and 2018.
