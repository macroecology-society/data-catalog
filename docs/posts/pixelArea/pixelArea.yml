 title: pixelArea
 short_description: Global map of per-pixel areas
 long_description: This dataset provides per-pixel estimtes of areas within a WGS84, lat/lon grid. This layer was derived with the Harvesine method, which estimates the distance in meters of a distance between two geographical points. This method was used to estimate the distance between the edges of a pixel, across both latitude and longitude. These distances were then used to estimate the are of the pixel.
