  Soil temperature bioclimatic variables
 long_description: |
  These dataset consists of soil temperature layers calculated by adding 
  monthly soil temperature offsets to monthly air-temperature maps from 
  the CHELSA dataset. These soil temperature layers were then used to 
  calculate annual means, temperature ranges, standard deviation, 
  warmest and coldest months and quarters. Wettest and driest quarters 
  were identified for each pixel based on CHELSA monthly values.
