 title: tidalFlats
 short_description: |
  Global distribution of tidal flats
 long_description: |
  This datasets maps tidal flats globally, derived with 707,528 
  Landsat acquisitions. These acquisitions were classified using 
  Machine learning thorugh Google Earth Engine. The original data 
  is provided at a 30-m resolution and on 5-year epochs. Here, we 
  filled temporal gaps with the nearest year, and aggregated the 
  original masks to into 300-m resolution layers, expressing 
  per-pixel percentages of tidal flats.
